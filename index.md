Introduction
============

The C++ Micro Services library provides a dynamic service registry based on the
service layer as specified in the OSGi R4.2 specifications. It enables users to
realize a service oriented approach within their software stack. The advantages
include higher reuse of components, looser coupling, better organization of
responsibilities, cleaner API contracts, etc.
