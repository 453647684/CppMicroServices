Build Instructions    {#BuildInstructions}
==================

The C++ Micro Services library provides [CMake][cmake] build scripts which allow the generation of
platform and IDE specific project files.

The library should compile on many different platforms. Below is a list of tested compiler/OS combinations:

  - GCC 4.5 (Ubuntu 11.04 and MacOS X 10.6)
  - Visual Studio 2008 and 2010
  - Clang 3.0 (Ubuntu 11.04 and MacOS X 10.6)


Prerequisites
-------------

- [CMake][cmake] 2.8 (Visual Studio 2010 users should use the latest CMake version available)
