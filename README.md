C++ Micro Services
==================

Introduction
------------

The C++ Micro Services library provides a dynamic service registry based on the
service layer as specified in the OSGi R4.2 specifications. It enables users to
realize a service oriented approach within their software stack.

The advantages include higher reuse of components, looser coupling, better organization of
responsibilities, cleaner API contracts, etc.

Requirements
------------

This is a pure C++ implementation of OSGi service model and does not have any third-party
library dependencies.

Build Instructions
------------------

You need [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) >= 2.8.4 for generating a native build system (Make files,
Visual Studio solution files, etc.) and a C++ compiler. The following platforms have been tested:

  - GCC 4.5 (Ubuntu 11.04 and MacOS X 10.6)
  - Visual Studio 2008 and 2010
  - Clang 3.0 (Ubuntu 11.04 and MacOS X 10.6)
